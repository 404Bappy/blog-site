    World renowned universities
Degrees from UK higher education providers are respected around the world, and the choice of subjects you can study is extensive. A degree from any British university will look great on a CV, and when looking for work in the future, no matter the industry and the location, having a qualification from the UK will be a great selling point. 

British higher education providers are recognised internationally for their creative and challenging environments, that help push students to be their best. Their standards are highly regarded, with experts on many academic topics, and they're generally high in internationally university rankings.

The British higher education system has been the basis for higher education standards around the world for a long time, with revolutionary teaching styles and modern facilities.  

The UK is multicultural
 The UK is a multicultural country and is also immensely popular with international students. In fact, the UK is the second most popular destination for overseas students in the world.

This diversity means our campuses are alive with different cultures. You can mix with people from around the world and learn so much more than just what you are studying on your degree.  Brilliant work opportunities
Generally, an international student can work up to 20 hours a week during term-time, and ten hours when school is out. This allows students to take on a part-time job or an internship, to learn new skills and earn money while studying.

Your university may even help you secure an internship as part of your course, which will most certainly give you a competitive edge when you graduate.

The UK Government has also announced a new post-study visa that will allow international students who graduate from the summer of 2021 to stay and work in the UK for a further two years.

Financial benefits
International students can enjoy some financial benefits when choosing the UK.

Firstly, a degree in the UK takes less time to complete than in other countries. In many countries it takes four years, plus two or three extra years to complete a postgraduate degree. In the UK it takes three years for an undergraduate degree and then one extra to complete a postgraduate qualification (unless you are a medical or research student). 

International students can also get financial help when studying in the UK, in the form of scholarships, grants and bursaries.  Furthermore, living costs in the UK, especially when outside of cities like London, are reasonable.

Research the area before applying to the university to better understand the prices, but generally, entertainment, food, and rent is cheaper than the US.

Unique culture
If you decide to study in the UK, you won’t be bored, there is always something to do no matter your interests are. The UK is a unique country, filled with many families with roots from around the world. This leaves the UK with a unique mix of different cultures, food, and interests. You will not just learn about British culture, but from people from other countries and cultures too.

No matter what part of the UK you move to, you will find a mix of restaurants, nightlife, shops, and sporting activities to keep you interested. The Brits love to visit art galleries, bars, concerts, and open-air markets – so you will always find something to entertain yourself with outside of class hours.

    <p class="card-text">nternational student life in Germany
International student life in Germany can be challenging without the right support system. International students face bureaucratic hurdles, from dealing with landlords during the apartment search to the Ausländerbehörde during the registration process. Additionally, language barriers can lead to further difficulties and social isolation amongst international students in Germany. A community for international students where they can ask for and receive support from other international and German students on various topics and personal, academic and professional challenges would enhance the quality of international student life in Germany exponentially. 

DEGIS – The largest association for International Students in Germany
The number of international students in Germany is increasing every year. Nevertheless, many international students are confronted with various problems, both before and during their stay in Germany. These range from bureaucratic and language barriers to social isolation and difficulties gaining a foothold in the job market. On these matters, international offices mostly focus their initiatives on a local or regional level.

Recognizing this need for a supra-regional community to enhance international student life in Germany, an association for international students in Germany named DEGIS was brought to life in 2019. DEGIS offers various informative and practical services to international students across universities and cities in Germany before and during their stay in Germany. The non-profit organization also acts as a voice of international students towards academia, the economy, and politics in Germany.

What services does DEGIS offer international students?
City Chapters
DEGIS offers international students a community and platform that empowers them to succeed in Germany. International students can get involved in one of over 50 City Chapters across Germany at DEGIS in the following areas: marketing, events & projects, business development, and Human resources. Additionally, these City Chapters offer online and in person events for networking with other international students in the city on personal and career development topics. Examples include a dinner night, running club, and company tours. 

Buddy Programm
The DEGIS Buddy Program was launched in the Wintersemester 2020/2021 with the goal of connecting one or more incoming international students – “incoming buddies” – with experienced senior international students in Germany – “local buddies” -. The aim of the program is that the local buddies, who have a better understanding of the challenges of newly arriving international students in Germany, help the incoming buddies on overcoming these challenges and have a smooth start in Germany. While international offices have similar offerings for international students, they are often focused on exchange students and do not always reach all the international students that would benefit from the initiative. As DEGIS is in very close connection to degree-seeking international students it acts as a complementary offering for already existing buddy programs of international offices. 

Online Services
The DEGIS online offerings comprises both information on the website and across various social media platforms. The DEGIS website has useful information on living and studying in Germany and what to consider for setting up a blocked account and about visa and health insurance. In addition, the DEGIS Instagram Account offers updates on the community for the community while the DEGIS LinkedIn Account offers updates on the community for the community and stakeholders from the economy, politics and academia in Germany. The DEGIS Facebook Community is a forum for international students to ask questions and receive answers on topics related to studying and living in Germany, from bureaucratic hurdles to learning the language. 

What makes DEGIS unique?
DEGIS is unique because it is a community from international students for international students. The core team comprises individuals of current or former international students in Germany stemming from Brazil, Belarus and India to name a few countries. Additionally, DEGIS members benefit from the peer-to-peer support of the community. Being an international student is a shared responsibility and trait amongst the DEGIS community. This feeling of belonging is extremely important for international students new to the country and culture.

What are the different memberships at DEGIS?
At DEGIS, there are two types of memberships. There is the active membership and the community membership which international students can apply to.

As an active member, it is important to dedicate at least 2-3 hours a week to the DEGIS cause. An active member is allocated to a City Chapter and takes on a role in this City Chapter with the aim to expand the DEGIS network and create an unforgettable experience for international students in Germany. There are currently over 300 active members as part of the DEGIS community.

Most of DEGIS is composed of community members. There are currently over 15,000 community members as part of the DEGIS community. As a community member, DEGIS members do not become part of the City Chapter but still have the chance to subscribe to the DEGIS social media channels and newsletter and take part in various workshops.
