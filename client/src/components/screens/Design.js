    <p class="card-text">
    Graphic design is a profession,[2] academic discipline[3][4][5] and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.[6] Graphic design is an interdisciplinary branch of design[1] and of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages. Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic message into a graphic manifestation.[7]

Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example, it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be applied in the aviation world[8] or space exploration.[9][10] In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge range of types and classes where it can be applied.

With origins in antiquity and the Middle Ages,[11] graphic design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer culture in the industrial revolution. From there it emerged as a distinct profession in the West, closely associated with advertising in the 19th century[12] and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century. Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today, the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever, particularly because of the development of new technologies and the need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the engineers who develop them.[13]

Reticulated Giraffe Conservation in Kenya
Preparations are well under way for a large conservation effort to better understand and conserve reticulated giraffe in northern Kenya. Supported by World Giraffe Day 2016 funding, GCF is working closely with San Diego Zoo Global, Kenya Wildlife Service, Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, Loisaba Conservancy, Northern Rangeland Trust, The Nature Conservancy and local communities in Kenya to learn more about these gentle giants and support their long-term future in the wild. Stay tuned for more information about this exciting initiative shortly. as our team will be on the ground over the next month to fit new GPS satellite units to several reticulated giraffe in northern Kenya.

East Africa Programme Update
In mid-2016, GCF opened an East African office, based in Nairobi, to better support giraffe conservation initiatives in the region by establishing a regional base. The efforts focus on collaborations with government institutions, private stakeholders and local and international NGOs. The region is critical for the long-term survival of wild populations of giraffe as it is home to three distinct species of giraffe: Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata) and Nubian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis). Read more about this exciting initiative towards conserving the three species in the region.
