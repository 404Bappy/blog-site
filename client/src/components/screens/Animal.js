    <p class="card-text">
    largest member of the cat family (Felidae), rivaled only by the lion (Panthera leo) in strength and ferocity. The tiger is endangered throughout its range, which stretches from the Russian Far East through parts of North Korea, China, India, and Southeast Asia to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. The Siberian, or Amur, tiger (P. tigris altaica) is the largest, measuring up to 4 metres (13 feet) in total length and weighing up to 300 kg (660 pounds). The Indian, or Bengal, tiger (P. tigris tigris) is the most numerous and accounts for about half of the total tiger population. Males are larger than females and may attain a shoulder height of about 1 metre and a length of about 2.2 metres, excluding a tail of about 1 metre; weight is 160–230 kg (350–500 pounds), and tigers from the south are smaller than those of the north.

The Indo-Chinese (P. tigris corbetti), and Sumatran (P. tigris sumatrae) tigers are bright reddish tan, beautifully marked with dark, almost black, vertical stripes. The underparts, the inner sides of the limbs, the cheeks, and a large spot over each eye are whitish. The rare Siberian tiger has longer, softer, and paler fur. White tigers, not all of them true albinos, have occurred from time to time, almost all of them in India (see also albinism). Black tigers have been reported less frequently from the dense forests of Myanmar (Burma), Bangladesh, and eastern India. The tiger has no mane, but in old males the hair on the cheeks is rather long and spreading. Although most classifications separate the species into six subspecies, some merge subspecies or suggest that two tiger species exist, P. tigris on the mainland of Asia and P. sondaica of Java, Bali, and Sumatra.

Natural history
Sumatran tiger

The tiger has adapted to a great variety of environments, from the Siberian taiga, where nights can be as cold as −40 °C (−40 °F), to the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans, where the temperatures reach more than 40 °C (104 °F). Tigers haunt the ruins of buildings such as courts and temples and are at home in habitats ranging from dry grassland to rainforest. Grasslands, mixed grassland-forests, and deciduous rather than densely canopied forests support maximum population densities, as these habitats maintain the highest number of prey species. Having evolved in the temperate and subtropical forests of eastern Asia, the tiger is less tolerant of heat than other large cats, which may explain why it is an adept swimmer that appears to enjoy bathing. Under stress it may climb trees.

The tiger usually hunts by night and preys on a variety of animals, but it prefers fairly large prey such as deer (sambar, chital, and swamp deer) and wild pigs. A special liking for porcupines, despite the danger of injury from their quills, is an exception. Healthy large mammals are generally avoided, although there have been recorded instances of the tiger’s having attacked elephants and adult water buffalo. Cattle are occasionally taken from human habitations, and some tigers can thrive on domestic livestock. After making a kill and consuming what it can, it makes a deliberate attempt to hide the carcass from vultures and other scavengers so that another meal can be obtained. Tigers are not averse to commandeering a kill from other tigers or leopards, and they sometimes eat carrion. Skill in killing and obtaining prey is only partly instinctive, maternal training being essential for proficiency. For this reason, tigers raised in captivity would not fare well if released into the wild. As the top predator throughout its range, the tiger plays a major role in controlling not only its prey population but that of other predators such as the leopard, dhole (Asiatic wild dog), and clouded leopard. No trait of the tiger has fascinated humans more than man eating. A number of reasons account for this—disability caused by age or injury, paucity of prey, acquisition of the habit from the mother, or defense of cubs or kill. With the reduction in the number of tigers, the occurrence of man-eating tigers has become rare except in the Sundarbans, the northeast Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, and neighbouring Nepal in and around Royal Chitwan National Park.

    <p class="card-text"> It is great to see increasing interest in and awareness for giraffe and their plight in the international media. At the same time, GCF and partners continue to work hard on turning this alarming trend around. While there is a lot of doom and gloom released on the future of giraffe in Africa, we prefer to let our actions talk, highlight conservation successes and build on our amazing partnerships throughout Africa. To keep updated on our important work, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and visit our website, where we post regular update reports on our programmes and initiatives.

GCF Annual Report 2016/17


GCF recently released our first Annual Report as a fully Namibia-based organisation. To find out more about our 2016/17 key giraffe conservation activities, programmes, partners, supporters and exciting plans for the next financial year, download the GCF Annual Report 2016/17 – even if only for the beautiful images.
World Giraffe Day – 21 June 2017
Only one month to go! For this year’s WGD we are increasing awareness for and raising funding to save Masai giraffe in Kenya and Tanzania. Join us in celebrating these amazing animals. Masai giraffe numbers have dropped by over 50% in the last 30 years and it is time we curb this trend.

To ‘wear’ your support for giraffe on WGD, order your t-shirt NOW! The GCF Online Shop offers an amazing new range of apparel and other merchandise designed by our creative partner Animalia Collective. Your purchase directly supports our conservation work throughout Africa.

Reticulated Giraffe Conservation in Kenya
Preparations are well under way for a large conservation effort to better understand and conserve reticulated giraffe in northern Kenya. Supported by World Giraffe Day 2016 funding, GCF is working closely with San Diego Zoo Global, Kenya Wildlife Service, Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, Loisaba Conservancy, Northern Rangeland Trust, The Nature Conservancy and local communities in Kenya to learn more about these gentle giants and support their long-term future in the wild. Stay tuned for more information about this exciting initiative shortly. as our team will be on the ground over the next month to fit new GPS satellite units to several reticulated giraffe in northern Kenya.

East Africa Programme Update
In mid-2016, GCF opened an East African office, based in Nairobi, to better support giraffe conservation initiatives in the region by establishing a regional base. The efforts focus on collaborations with government institutions, private stakeholders and local and international NGOs. The region is critical for the long-term survival of wild populations of giraffe as it is home to three distinct species of giraffe: Masai giraffe (Giraffa tippelskirchi), reticulated giraffe (Giraffa reticulata) and Nubian giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis camelopardalis). Read more about this exciting initiative towards conserving the three species in the region.
